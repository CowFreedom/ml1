In our example we use logistic regression.

<train>
In this folder we train our model. This is not part of the submission.
After execution of the "train_model.py" script, weights are calculated.

<submission>
This folder is what we will submit. It includes the weights for our model and a
"sample_submission" script.
#As usual, nothing is finished yet
